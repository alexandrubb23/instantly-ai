## Assignment Description

This project is a coding assignment for AI engineers. The goal is to build a simple web app that allows users to generate and save emails, featuring:

- A sidebar with a list of emails (Apple Mail style)
- A compose form with To, CC, BCC, Subject, and Body fields
- An AI-powered drafting assistant that routes prompts to specialized assistants (Sales or Follow-up) and streams generated content into the form
- All emails are saved in the database (no actual sending required)
- Built as a monorepo with Next.js frontend and Fastify backend
- Uses MUI for frontend design

See the assignment instructions and test cases in the original README for more details.
